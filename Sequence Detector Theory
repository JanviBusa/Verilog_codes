What is a Sequence Detector?
=> A sequence detector is a sequential state machine that takes an input string of bits and generates an output 1 whenever the target sequence has been detected. 
  In a Mealy machine, output depends on the present state and the external input (x).

Sequence detector is of two types: 
    1. Overlapping
    2. Non-Overlapping
-In an overlapping sequence detector, the last bit of one sequence becomes the first bit of the next sequence.
-However, in a non-overlapping sequence detector, the last bit of one sequence does not become the first bit of the next sequence.
